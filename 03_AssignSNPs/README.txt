This directory serves the purpose of assigning AIMs (SNPs) within each population's dataset to the gene classes identified in the directory 01_SortingOrthoFinderResults.

This was necessary because species-distinct ancestry informative markers (AIMs) were sometimes different across each population (CALL, CHAF, HUEX-STAC), so they were assigned independent of one another.
