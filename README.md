Repository for the manuscript titled "sensitivity of genome-wide tests for mitonuclear genetic incompatibilities"

to reproduce results or to see how to use the scripts in this repository, please see ScriptOrder.txt in the main directory. Outputs from the previous methods are not included in subsequent analyses (i.e., scripts further down the pipeline depend on outputs from previous runs, but I have not included those outputs here)
